# Enoch Pratt Library Process Week 1

I am currently in week 1 of the Pratt Library Redesign. So far I have been delving into the user research, competitive analysis, and the creative brief. No "designing" as been done quite yet. In my user research I interviewed 5 MICA students, my target audience, about their thoughts on the Pratt Library and then made 3 personas based off of them to make a well rounded experience of who would be using the site. I then made a competitive analysis sheet and picked multiple criteria for the website to encompass. I then found 5 competing websites that fulfilled the criteria. Afterwards I ended with compiling all of my research into a creative brief.
