# Enoch Pratt Library Process Week 1

I am currently in week 1 of the Pratt Library Redesign. So far I have been delving into the user research, competitive analysis, and the creative brief. No "designing" as been done quite yet. In my user research I interviewed 5 MICA students, my target audience, about their thoughts on the Pratt Library and then made 3 personas based off of them to make a well rounded experience of who would be using the site. I then made a competitive analysis sheet and picked multiple criteria for the website to encompass. I then found 5 competing websites that fulfilled the criteria. Afterwards I ended with compiling all of my research into a creative brief.

# Enoch Pratt Library Process Week 2

Last week I finished the last of the user research so I begin designing. I designed Page Description Diagrams that distinguished the difference between high, medium and low level priority items for each of the 6 pages I am designing. Based on my user research, the highest priority item was constant accessibility of the Search Bar. Another high priority item is the Location & Hours Page. After selecting items' priorities, I designed rough wireframes for where information would be located on each page. I then made a style tile that depicted the aesthetic direction I want to go towards which will be clean, simple and minimal.

# Enoch Pratt Library Process Week 3

This week I began creating browser-based wireframes for my 6 pages of the Pratt Library. I began to create with Bootstrap components from what we learned in class, however I switched over to UXPin due to the complications that arose with Bootstrap. For my wireframes my goal was to just place all of the elements on to each of the pages without designing them. I just wanted to see the functionality. The sidenav is an important element of my pages because it is the core of the navigation through my site. An interesting side note that helps with functionality is that you will be able to compress and expand the nav on the left side.

Because I was somewhat behind from last weeks assignment, I just now began to code my website this week so I was caught trying to not only add the core, basic elements to my website but also include stylistic details. It was a challenge and I still am left with a few kinks and questions. I am still left questioning how to handle my nav bar and how to have it collapse and expand. I did not think while designing my flats how complicated and challenging the coding would be for it. But nonetheless I have made progress, while it may be slow progress and while continue to code this page for the next week.

# Enoch Pratt Library Process Week 5

This week I have made a lot of headway in terms of the coding as well as made tweaks to my design as well. I found the Google Nexus Nav Bar that works great for my site. It was very complicated to figure out how ot incorporate in into my already existing page. I am actually still working on getting the nav bar to fit perfectly into each page. I also made some great headway with my hovering of a book image. I have almost worked all of the kinks out of that as well. I do still have a few pages that I need to design so while I am behind schedule I am still hopeful that I can finish in time for the March 4th deadline.
