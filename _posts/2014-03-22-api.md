# API Process Week 1

I am currently in week 1 of the API project. Our assignment was to explore using APIs and interact with them while learning the basics of Javascript. After doing a bit of research to fully understand what APIs do, I decided that I would build a site that would allow you to find songs that were a certain mood, tempo, and duration for your workout. Once this was decided, I began to write my creative brief and design my style tile. I also found a great pre-existing API called Echonest that I would be pulling information and data from.

# API Process Week 2

In the next week, after spring break, I was further developing my concept and especially my website flats. I knew I wanted it to be simple because I really wanted to learn Javascript more than design a pretty website for the API. During these next few weeks it was a lot of researching and repeating steps that I learned in class. By the end of the project I had developed a very very simple site for Echonest's API but it was a great learning experience and it definitely helped me understand the basics of Javascript.
